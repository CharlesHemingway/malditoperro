By Ossiel Romero

The theft of fuel in Mexico, previously a clandestine and isolated crime, has been transformed into an economic and public security crisis in the last decade costing the country billions in losses. Fuel theft is the legal and technical term recognized by authorities for the crime, however in the roads and towns surrounding the supply networks, it is widely known as huachicoleo and those who take part in it as, huachicoleros.

**The Crime
**

In Mexico, ALMO's government began its 2019 presidency with a national crack down on massive fuel theft at Pemex which has been ongoing for decades under the supervision of corrupt government and company officials. At least 3 billion dollars in fuel were stolen yearly from Mexico’s state-run fuel depots at Pemex.

An average of about 42 illegal taps are estimated to occur daily, however this only represents about 20 percent of losses stolen while the vast majority of the theft is committed directly from distribution centers aboard tanker trucks. It is estimated that at least 600 tanker trucks carrying fuel worth about $10 million are used daily to carry out the fuel theft. Pemex employees have been long suspected of being involved in the thefts, due to the complexity of drilling holes on pipelines without causing an explosion. Similar to the tragic incident of January, 18, 2019 in Tlahuelilpan where a pipeline ruptured by oil thieves exploded, killing at least 117 people and leaving even more survivors scarred for life with severe burns.

**Government response
**

The military has confiscated and secured 58 pipelines across the country by orders of the President in a attempt to halt the ongoing fuel theft. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said thieves don’t just drill taps into government pipelines. Pemex employees are also stealing fuel and distributing it, or helping thieves by ensuring fuel continues to flow through compromised pipelines.

There is an opened investigation against three senior Pemex executives and more than a dozen other people have had their bank accounts frozen, all suspects remain unnamed by the government. There is also a confirmed ongoing investigation against a former Peña Nieto associate, brigadier general Eduardo León Trauwitz who was responsible for the security of Pemex during the past six years.

According to President Lopez Obrador “There is a hypothesis that of all the thefts, only about 20 percent is done by illegal pipeline taps,” he also added “It’s a kind of smoke-screen, and the majority is done through a scheme that involves the complicity of authorities and a distribution network.” The government reports it has arrested at least 558 people accused of stealing fuel. In order to persuade low level thieves to stop stealing fuel the government has also launched a new 3,600 peso monthly scholarship for impoverished youth, a program pitched as a way to address the root causes of crime and 40,000 youths will be selected for the first round.

**The hidden enemy
**

It is currently unknown how much of the stolen oil is actually sold and to who. Some experts believe the fuel is being redistributed illegally to complicit gasoline stations, construction companies, and factories however this would not account for the volume of fuel stolen. Some theories suggest the stolen fuel is being distributed and smuggled to foreign entities in the United States and elsewhere. Many places across the country, and mainly surrounding Mexico City, are suffering from severe fuel shortages due to the government's operation to confiscate and secure Pemex pipelines. In response to the shortages the government quickly restored the pipeline operations to meet demands for fuel.

Despite the quick turnaround by the government a mysterious automated campaign swept social media with the use of botnets and fake personas to push a heavy misinformation operation in what appears to be an organized effort to incite a run on already depleted gas stations and flame civil unrest. Much of the rhetoric was Right Wing and pushed to correlate the new leftist government as a mirror of the Maduro regime of Venezuela. Like in Venezuela the state owned fuel pipelines are experiencing an uptick of mysterious sabotage incidents since ALMO declared the operation to investigate and end fuel theft at Pemex. Notably a key pipeline running from the port of Tuxpan in Veracruz to Mexico City was shut down after being tampered with early in the morning on January 11 and repaired, only to be struck again by another rupture at 11 p.m. that same night. Triggering angry anti government protests, long gas station lines, and economic risks. Prompting the president to declare "There's sabotage. Let's see who gets tired first."

**Unintended consequences
**

The head of Mexico's central bank announced that the economy and inflation rate could be negatively affected if fuel distribution problems persist. Many experts also warn that manufacturing facilities like auto plants could begin to close down. Meanwhile agriculture losses caused by accumulation of delayed shipments and spoiled supplies are estimated at nearly $300 million. Jonathan Heath, deputy governor of the Bank of Mexico, told a congressional hearing that "If (the fuel shortage) goes on beyond February and March, who knows when we could start to get into something dangerous, and then I would be more worried… If it's a problem that lasts a week or two more weeks, and we see things starting to work themselves out, I think the effects could be minimal"

Federal officials remain undeterred by the challenges ahead and are confident that by targeting corrupt Pemex employees, securing key pipelines, and monitoring tankers they have already managed to reduce the thefts since the start of the operation.

The government as activated a hotline to combat fuel theft, if you or someone you know has information on any ongoing theft please report the huachicoleo to 01 800 228 96660 and email vigilante@pemex.com.
