Just as I was about to write this overdue article, Google tells me [Castro got there before me](http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=22074). Google also informs me that it is the name of several social media fan clubs, WAG’s of the military, etc. Cute.



This past Remembrance Day has convinced me that most people don’t even realize the WAG’s are not joking. This year, I heard the same stories about people’s grandfathers that I’ve heard every Remembrance Day of my life. But these armies are not our grandfather’s armies. The US military and its [contractors](http://www.stripes.com/news/middle-east/iraq/state-dept-planning-to-field-a-small-army-in-iraq-1.111839), are made up of [professional](http://www.thenation.com/blog/37877/iraq-withdrawal-obama-and-clinton-expanding-us-paramilitary-force-iraq), full time, cradle to grave soldiers. They are bred on hate and violent media, they are desensitized from childhood, and they enter the army as teenagers. These are not regular citizens forced to give up their daily lives for a period to defend their country. These are professional killers.



Their actions are [criminal](http://www.thenation.com/blog/154977/us-businessman-blackwater-paid-me-buy-steroids-and-weapons-black-market-its-shooters), not just as a few individuals going against the system, but by adhering to the system at all.  These armies are not fighting to defend civilians, to protect their families, homes and environments. When the wars are started and run in order to slaughter and terrorize citizens for the profit of industry, when food, shelter and safety are destroyed and drugs, oil and industry are protected, when environments are destroyed and free will is forbidden, this is not a citizen army.



I cannot put it better than [this](http://www.articlesbase.com/politics-articles/political-stewardship-military-or-mercenary-3687232.html#ixzz16PQFCmB9):

_“Elected leaders as managers for the nation who misuse the military as a personal tool for usurping the powers of the citizens are known as authoritarian oligarchies, tyrants or dictators. If a nation’s military core role and function to defend its citizens changes to suppressing its citizens, the military loses its national credibility and honors bestowed upon it by its citizens. Then, the military of a nation-state become a mercenary institution whose loyalty and service is for sale to the highest bidder. The generals of the military become co-dictators and become known as juntas which are basically military dictators. Any form of token civil governments under a junta is a just a rubber stamp and mouthpiece of the authoritarian oligarchies, tyrants or dictators. The nation-state categorically becomes a military state. All other legitimate powers within the nation-state become pawns and tools of the mercenary institution and juntas.”_



If there is any doubt about the state of today’s military here is a great resource about military contractors: http://www.kathryncramer.com/kathryn_cramer/mercenaries_pmcs_private_military_contractors/, or watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqM4tKPDlR8. These contractors are not only not a citizen army, they are criminals for hire, available to [private citizens](http://www.kathryncramer.com/kathryn_cramer/2006/12/the_domestic_us.html), [criminals](http://www.kathryncramer.com/kathryn_cramer/2006/12/iraqs_former_el.html), [industry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cri6yzWGMuk&feature=channel), and yes, of course, to any of the countries they are currently fighting against. The mercenary army was elevated to its current status by Bush in the Iraq war. Making money from war, and war crimes, is a [family tradition for Bush](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/sep/25/usa.secondworldwar), it obviously came naturally to him to connect war and industry even further. He created the huge billion dollar no-bid contracts that were awarded to republican backing mercenary firms such as Blackwater in Iraq, Afghanistan, post Katrina New Orleans and several areas in Africa. That’s not me being too lazy to research, it is impossible to say with any certainty where these armies are, what they are doing, or how many torture camp “prisons” they operate.



But those who felt that a new president was the answer have [had a shock](http://www.thenation.com/blog/36756/blackwaters-new-sugar-daddy-obama-administration). According to this article,

_“Bob Woodwards new book revealed that the CIA is operating a 3000 man secret army broken in to Counterterrorism Pursuit Teams, and when asked to respond to this the White House basically replied with an answer that suggested we – as Americans – should be proud of this development. For all the political rhetoric otherwise, the Obama administration has been remarkably aggressive in how they fight war – they support the use of CIA army’s, they have expanded the use of drone strikes, and despite campaign rhetoric otherwise –_[_ the Obama folks love private mercenary firms_](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/09/despite-clinton-pledge-state-department-ready-to-pay-mercs-billions/)_.”_



This appears to be the new US / NATO army, an international gang of thugs, armed to the teeth and earning billions per contract. How on earth is this to be stopped? The ever astute Castro pointed out:



_“They cannot even offer the hope that the world economic crisis can be overcome, or how much longer any improvement would last. The total public debt of the United States, not only that of central government, but the rest of the country’s public and private institutions, has already risen to a figure that is equal to the world GDP of 2009, which amounted to $58 trillion. Did those meeting in Lisbon maybe think to ask themselves where those fabulous resources came from? Simply, from the economy of all the other nations in the world, to which the United States handed over pieces of paper converted into dollar bills which, for 40 years now, unilaterally ceased having their backing in gold, and now that the value of that metal is 40 times superior. That country still possesses its veto within the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Why wasn’t that discussed in Portugal?”_



Good point. Especially since, if there is one thing we have learned from Rome, No money, No military, No empire.
